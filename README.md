PDF Merged

This is a Python script that merges multiple PDF files into a single file. It reads the files from the “Mixerpdf/files” folder, organizes them alphabetically, and then creates a new file named “PDF Merged.pdf” containing all the combined PDFs.

How to Use:

Make sure you have the PyPDF2 module installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:
pip install PyPDF2

Place the PDF files you want to merge in the “Mixerpdf/files” folder.
Run the Python script. It will read the files from the folder, merge the PDFs, and create a new file named “PDF Merged.pdf.”
Notes:

The PDF files must be in the “Mixerpdf/files” folder.
Make sure to number the files in the name (e.g., “01.Dom Casmurro.pdf,” “02.Hamlet.pdf,” etc.) to ensure the correct order during merging.
